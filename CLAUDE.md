# Agent Guide

## General

## Coding Workflow

- Test Driven Development: write a failing test, then code to make it pass, then
  refactor.
- Always use test driven development.
- Prefer green-to-green refactors without changing functionality.
- `git add .` and `git commit -m` after a successful TDD cycle or refactor.
- Branches should follow `feature/<name>`, `bug/<name>`, or `chore/<name>`.
- Avoid merging or pushing branches unless the user requests.

## Commit and Pull Request Messages

When you are writing a git commit message, or a pull request description, follow
these instructions:

- Act as a professional developer.
- Terse and helpful; present tense, facts only.
- Use Markdown formatting.
- Start with a one-line summary.
- If needed, add a blank line followed by bullet points beginning with `-`.
